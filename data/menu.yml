# Updating the menu:

# Click the edit button (looks like a pencil to the right of the page)

# Remember, indentation and seperating things with a dash is important!

# * Each section starts off with the section name, and a colon.
# * Each item is indented by two spaces
# * Each item starts with a dash ---> -
# * Separate the item name, description and price with a dash ---> -

# So in the end, a section and an item should look like this (minus the #):

# section_name:
#   - Item name - item description - $200
#   - Item name - item description - $200
