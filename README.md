##Updating the menu:

###Remember, indentation and seperating things with a dash is important!

* Each section starts off with the section name, and a colon.
* Each item is indented by two spaces
* Each item starts with a dash ---> -
* Separate the item name, description and price with a dash ---> -

So in the end, a section and an item should look like this (minus the #):

```yml
section_name:
  - Item name - item description - $200
  - Item name - item description - $200
```
